This app scrapes Huffington Post's front page for articles using Cheerio

User can save the articles to a mongo database (using mongoose) by clicking the save button

On the saved articles screen, user can comment on individual articles. Comments are stored in another collection in the db and linked to the specific article.

See a deployed version of the app here: https://newstter.herokuapp.com/
